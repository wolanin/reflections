When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	If you are using multiple computers or if there are other people working on the project.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because there may be changes on GitHub that you may not want locally.
